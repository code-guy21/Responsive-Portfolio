				<p>
					My name is Alexis San Javier. I was born in Mexico but I have lived in the USA, and
					specifically Florida, for most of my life.
				</p>

				<p>
					I grew up in Lakeland and after graduating from High School, I went on to attend the University of
					Central Florida. In 2017 I graduated with my BS in computer engineering, and after graduation,
					I worked as a research technician, and as an instructor at an after school academy teaching
					children how to program micro-controllers.
				</p>

				<p>
					As of recent I took a hiatus and have been contemplating my next career move. I have been
					experimenting with web apps and as a result, my interest in this area has grown. So to
					solidify and expand my skill in this area I have enrolled in a full-stack Bootcamp at The University
					of Central Florida. With this experience, I hope to start a new chapter in my career.
